# 1100 How Do Cloud Providers Offer Competitive Rates

## Factors that help Cloud providers offer low prices

Cloud providers offer varies sevices to businesses at affordable rates. To understand how they are able to offer these pricing options you need to understand two concepts: 

- Economies of Scale
- Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)

## Economies of Scale

Economies of Scale is the cost advantage that enterprises get when they operate at large scale. It allows organizations to do things efficiently. One of the important benefits of using cloud computing is the cost advantage. Benefits of economies of scale are leveraged by cloud providers such as Microsoft, Google, and Amazon which are large businesses.

The end users can clearly visualize the savings. As an example, you can get hardware at a low cost. To get tax savings the cloud providers make deals with local governments to lower costs for power and cooling and getting high speed network connectivity for inter-site communication. These benefits can then be passed on to end users in the form of lower prices. 

## Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)

Cloud helps you reduce Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) by providing a pay-as-you-go model and hence reduces the need to spend in large capital. This will allow you to have control over spending and procuring of resources and use them only when the business requires it. 

Calculation of Total Cost of Ownership comprises two apporaches:

- Capital Expenditure (CapEx)
- Operational Expenditure (OpEx)
