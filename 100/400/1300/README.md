# 1300 Operational Expenditure (OpEx)

***Operational Expenditure (OpEx)*** is the daily operational costs incurred on services or products. You can deduct this expense from you tax bill in the same year. There is no upfront cost. It involves pay-as-you-go pricing. 

Let's look at some benefits of OpEx:

You can benefit from OpEx in different scenarios.

- You have an enterprise app that needs on-demand scaling with OpEx in place. You only pay additional cost for the the amount of time you have scaled the resources. 

- You are running short of storage in your on-premise data center. You can get additional storage from cloud and safe on the CapEx cost. 

## OpEx Costs 

With cloud computing the costs that were incurred in an on-premise infrastructure shift to the service provider. Rather than physical hardware and data center cost, there is a different set of costs involved in cloud computing. 

Moving to cloud would incur the following operational costs:

- ***Leasing software and customized features***. You should actively manage the subscription to make sure users do not misuse services when using a pay-per-use model. Billing starts as and when the resources are provisioned. You can minimize the cost by making sure to de-provision the resources when they are not in.  
- ***Charges for scaling the resources based on demand***. You will be charged for scaling resources as and when required, depending on varies factors like Central Processing Unit (CPU) percentage, disc utilization, and Input/Output (I/O) operations per second (aka IOps). Capacity planning should be done to determine the bandwith needed. 
- ***Billing at the user- or organization-level***. The organizations and users are billed depending on the subscription or pay-per-use billing method on a recurring basis. The computing resources can be scaled, customized, and provisioned which may also include software, storage, and development platforms. As an example, when using a Virtual Machine (VM) in cloud, you might pay based on the number of virtual CPUs, Cores, and usage.
