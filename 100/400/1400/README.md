# 1400 Benefits of OpEx over CapEx

Now that you know what Operational Expenditure (OpEx) and Capital Expenditure (CapEx) are, let's understand the benefits of OpEx over CapEx.

- One of the challenges of CapEx are the unpredictable growth and demand which can outpace expectations, while on the other side companies that want to try a new product or a new service don't need to invest in physical hardware with the OpEx model. Instead they pay for the infrastructure based on the utilization and demand.
- When the demand is unknown, then the OpEx model is very beneficial. Cloud services are often called Agile, which provide capability to rapidly change an IT infrastructure to meet the ever changing needs of a business. 

| OpEx | CapEx |
| --- | --- |
| Test new products or services without investment in hardware. | Unpredictable growth and demand can outpace expectations. |
| Scale infrastructure on demand. | Difficult to scale on demand. |
| Optimize cost management. | Incur high infrastructure costs. |
