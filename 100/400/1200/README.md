## CapEx Costs

We'll now taking a look at how having an on-premise data center would incur the following costs.

1. ***Server Costs***: it comprises all the costs needed to purchase and support the server hardware. The servers should be designed to be fault tolerant and redundant. With the current trend in technology your existing hardware might become obsolete and you would continuously need to replace the server which would incur upfront cost and effect your cashflow. 

2. ***Storage Costs***: it comprises all the costs needed to purchase and support the storage hardware. Centralized storage can be expensive depending on application and level of fault tolerance. Organizations can have different storage tiers, which can be used for different scenarios ranging from using higher cost storage for mission critical applications and lower cost storage for low priority data. 

3. ***Network Costs***: it comprises costs needed for all on-premise hardware components like cabling, switches, access-points, and routers. This also includes costs for Internet connection and wireless area network (WAN). 

4. ***Backup & Archive Costs***: it comprises costs to backup, copy, or archive data. It would include having backup to and from the cloud. This would also include the costs for maintaining backup and data storage devices like tapes or discs.    

5. ***Organization continuity and disaster recovery costs***: businesses should have a disaster recovery plan in place. The plan should include creating a data recovery site and backup generators, which would require an upfront cost to build and maintain a data recovery site. 

6. ***Data Center Infrastructure Costs***: it includes costs to build, construct, and maintain the data center. In addition to this, operational expenses for electricity, floor space, cooling and building are also incurred.  

7. ***Technical Personnel***: you would need dedicated resources, which have technical expertise to install, manage and deploy the systems to your infrastructure.
