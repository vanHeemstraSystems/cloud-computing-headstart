# 1100 Cloud Computing: Present and Future

## Cloud Computing: Present

In today's world everything in digitally connected to cloud computing. The cloud world has now been led to new jobs, services, applications, and platforms. The future of cloud computing will help to create hybrid solutions, which are a combination of various cloud-based software services, products, and on-premises compute. Cloud provides security and control over data and is scalable and flexible. Having a process that is organized and finding a better way of processing data would be an integral part of cloud computing. The several features of cloud is what makes its future brighter in the industry.  

## Cloud Computing: Future

Let's have a look at some of the predictions in the field of cloud computing.

- ***Upscaled Storage Capacity***: The amount of data generated today is huge and it is difficult to store and maintain security of huge data. To securely store the data businesses require a place. This is the mayor reason for increased adoption of cloud computing by businesses. 

- ***Enhanced Performance with Internet of Things (IoT)***: With the advent of cloud, the utilization of Internet of Things (IoT) has increased. 

- ***Storage of Software Components***: The complexity of a software increases if it is not divided into modules. Advanced system thinking will soon be required by cloud computing. It is possible that different components of a software will reside on servers of several cloud providers. 

- ***Increased Adoption of Software as a Service (SaaS)***: The cloud computing market is growing rapidly and it is expected that a lot of businesses, approximately 60%, will offer their services in the form of Software as a Service based application.  

- ***Enhanced Security***: Security has always remained a major concern in cloud. With the increased amount of data stored in cloud, it is predicted that cloud will have improved better ways to protect the data from cyber attacks.
