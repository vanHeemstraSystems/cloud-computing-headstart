# 1200 Cloud Computing: Beyond

Let's now look at the technologies that can be considered when thinking about what is after cloud computing:

- ***Edge Computing***: It allows you to process data which is producec by Internet of Things (IoT). It includes devices on which computation is performed. The edge is bascially comprised computing nodes distributed across geographies. Some use cases where edge computing has a key role, would be Internet of Things, Cloud gaming, smart cities, and Augmented Reality (AR).

- ***Complexity Growth***: The pace with which cloud is growing and evolving can lead to lack of resources with required expertise. Technical and management complexity are mostly faced by the businesses today. These complexities can be eliminated by making people learn the new features in the cloud.

- ***Specialized Cloud***: This is probably going to be an extension to community cloud. Specialized clouds will be available to a smaller group of people to perform some specific task. It can include clouds which will be able to perform specific operations, like analytics and marketing.

- ***Distributed Technology***: The shared or distributed technology will allow data to be distributed across different regions, which will help in reducing the latency to retrieve data.  

- ***Cryptocurrency***: Cryptocurrency is a digital assets or electronic money, which uses the identity of a user to control creation of an asset and protect the transaction. You can quickly send money with the help of cryptocurrency without having the need to involve third-party banks. Examples of cryptocurrency: Bitcoin, XRP (Ripple).
