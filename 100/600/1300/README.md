# 1300 Big Data on Cloud

## Big Data and Cloud

As we know Big Data and Cloud are major mainstream tech stacks, which have been trending in technology today. 

They are different, as cloud mostly deals with infrastructure whilst Big Data mostly deals with a large amount of data.  

However, the major reason behind their adoption by enterprises is the simplification and collaboration offered by these two technologies. 

Let's look at an example.

The healthcare industry has been revolutionized with the introduction of wearable devices and sensors. These devices are capable of providing realtime data of patient's electronic health records. Using Big Data services this data can be easily visualized and helps customers easily view their realtime health data on the go.  

## Benefits of Big Data on Cloud

Now let's discuss the benefits of Big Data on Cloud.

- ***Improved Analysis***: Big Data analytics has improved with advancements in cloud computing. Cloud helps businesses integrate data from different sources and perform Big Data analysis on it.

- ***Simplified Infrastructure***: As data is increasing day by day, it is almost impossible to scale the physical infrastructure. Cloud computing provides flexibility to customers to scale as and when the data increases.   

- ***Cost Optimization***: Cloud allows customers to process huge data without having to invest in large scale Big Data resources. Capital Expenditure (CapEx) turns into Operational Expenditure (OpEx) with pay-per-use model of the cloud allowing companies to save the cost. 

- ***Security and Privacy***: When it comes to enterprise data, data privacy and security are major concerns. Security being a major concern, businesses have now started bringing in private cloud solutions to have enhanced security.
