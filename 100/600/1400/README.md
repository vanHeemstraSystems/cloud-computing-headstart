## DevOps and Cloud

With the evolving IT landscape, meeting the demand of end-users has become a top priority. The combination of DevOps and cloud makes this easier to manage with cost effectiveness. DevOps teams now have more control over their components, which allows them to work more efficiently.   

## Benefits of DevOps on Cloud

Let's look at its benefits.

- ***Quick Setup and Easy Automation***: Help save time that would have been incurred in manual operations.
- ***Scalability***: Meets unpredictable demand. 
- ***Orchestration***: Allows you to automate processes using various tools that easily integrate with the cloud.
- ***Rapid Deployment***: Allows for faster releases and reduced Time-to-Market.
- ***Effective Monitoring***: As an example, consider you have an application running and it has got more traffic eventually. As a result you might have to increase servers to meet this demand. This is where you can configure alerts to notify you about adding a new server.
- ***Maintenance-Free Operations***: Allows you to save time and cost involved in performing maintenance activities.  
- ***Enhanced Security***: Is prebuild into different phases involved in the DevOps lifecycle.
