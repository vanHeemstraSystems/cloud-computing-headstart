# 1500 IoT on Cloud

## Internet of Things (IoT) and Cloud

Internet of Things (IoT) involves a collection of services which helps connect, monitor, and control IoT devices. For data collection and processing IoT systems use sensors. 

With the increase in the number of devices that emit data, cloud plays a key role in storing and processing data. 

Let's look at an example.

Automated watering of a plant can be done depending on the moisture level using soil moisture sensors. The data of soil moisture level can be stored on cloud to help process the event.
