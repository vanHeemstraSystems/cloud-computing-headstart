# 1700 Four-Step Plan for Cloud Migration

## Step 1: Define Strategy and Perform Assessment 

### 1: Set Business Strategy

Setting the business strategy align to the project and identifying your organization's current readiness for operating in cloud will help you achieve the desired business outcomes. 

Business Criteria:

- ***Establish clear business outcomes.*** Drive transparency and engagement for your journey across the organization.

- ***Define business justification.*** Select the right technology by identifying business value opportunities. 

### 2: Use Split Approach for Cloud Migration

As the journey to adopt cloud starts, implementing the first application is the key to learning and testing with confidence. Use a split approach to select it. 

Business Criteria:

Perform a readiness assessment by:

- ***Identifying applications that need to move to cloud.*** Identify an application currently in operation where the owner has a strong motivation to move to cloud.

Technical Criteria:

Perform a readiness assessment by:

- ***Choosing applications with minimum dependencies and assets.*** Select an application that can be moved as a small group of assets and has minimum dependencies. 

### 3: Use Tools to Help You Plan

A few tools to help you with the process are:

- ***[Cloud Adoption Readiness Tool (CART)](https://cloudreadiness.amazonaws.com/#/cart) from Amazon Web Services (AWS).*** 

- ***[Azure Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/tco/calculator/).*** TCO Calculator can be used to estimate the cost savings that can be realized by migrating your application workloads to Azure. 

- ***[Azure Pricing Calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/calculator).*** Estimate your expected monthly bill by using the pricing calculator. 

- ***[Azure Cost Management](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cost-management/).*** Use and manage Azure and other cloud resources through multiple cloud cost management solution. 

## Step 2: Plan for Readiness and Other Processes 

As a part of this step of cloud migration:

- ***Address gaps uncovered in the assessment phase.*** 

- ***Keep resources prepared with technical readiness.***

- ***Set in place processes to drive business and technology changes.***

- ***Define a technology plan to enable business outcomes.***

- ***Focus on building your baseline environment.***

## Step 3: Adopt and Migrate 

### Adoption and Migration

- ***Design, migrate, and validate each application.*** In this phase, each application designed, migrated, and validated.

Cloud migration is the process of moving data and application digital business operations into the cloud. 

- ***Replicate existing resources to cloud with the least changes.*** Existing resources are replicated to the cloud with the least changes. 

- ***Transition users from the exisitng solution to the cloud solution,*** once an application or workload becomes operational in the cloud.

### Preparation

Preparation for migration can be done by establishing a rough migration backlog, which is based on the current state and desired outcomes. 

Business outcomes:

- ***Set business objectives.*** The key business objectives that drive this migration are defined in the plan stage.

Resource estimate:

- ***Prepare an estimate of the workloads to be migrated.*** A rough estimate of the number and health of workloads to be migrated is defined in the plan stage.

Roles and responsibilities:

- ***Define the team structure, access requirements, and separation of responsibilities.*** A clear definition of the team structure, access requirements, and separation of responsibilities is defined in the readiness stage. 

Change management requirements:

- ***Specify processes and documentation required to review and approve changes.*** The processes and documentation required to review and approve changes is defined in the readiness stage.

## Step 4: Govern, Manage, and Optimize

As you adopt cloud there are clear milestones and noticable business benefits.

When an organization begins the journey to move to cloud the final state of cloud adoption is not known. This final state starts appearing as and when your organizations moves or deploys new applications to cloud. 

Considering the below aspects of managing and operating a cloud platform is important. You should define governance solutions for your cloud environment that meet your organizations business requirements, help control risks, and provide agility.
