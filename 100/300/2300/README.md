# 2300 Business Case Studies: Adobe

## Adobe

Adobe has long been identified with innovative creative software such as Adobe Photoshop, Acrobat Reader, and Creative Suite.

Adobe is known for its multimedia and creative software products.

But with the coming up of digital media, Adobe realised that it is not enough for businesses to create good-looking content. So Adobe introduced Adobe Experience Cloud. A set of tools that accompanies Adobe Creative Cloud, by allowing businesses to:

- deliver tailored content to any audience,  
- track it from engagement to adaptation,
- and use the data to produce insights and shape action.

"Using Azure frees us to focus on where we add value - developing great software 
and delivering great customer experiences."
- Mike Mellor, Senior Director, Technical Operations

Adobe has achieved many things, because of cloud, such as:

- Running a massive SaaS business from Cloud and it has moved to a subscription-based model, which has lead to increased business and recurring revenue.
- Focusing on core business by making resources available that are used to take care of on-premise data centers.
- Multilayer security to protect big SaaS applications. 
- Delivering great customer experiences with outstanding performance and availability.
