# 1100 Cloud Migration

## Why Cloud Adoption?

- ***Greater Business Agility***: this means that you can bring your applications and services to market faster and have a reduced time-to-market.
- ***Cost Savings***: it saves cost as you need not invest to buy physical hardware or infrastructure. If your oirganization wants to do a Proof of Concept (PoC) or pilot of an application it would be faster and less expensive on cloud.
- ***Reduced Maintenance***: you need not worry about the upgrade and maintenance of cloud. You can just renew the licence and maintain the infrastructure. Cloud providers will take care of this.
- ***Environment Friendly***: cloud helps your organization by reducing the carbon footprints.
