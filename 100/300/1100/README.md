# 1100 Cloud Migration

## Why Cloud Adoption?

- ***Greater Business Agility***: this means that you can bring your applications and services to market faster and have a reduced time-to-market.
- ***Cost Savings***: it saves cost as you need not invest to buy physical hardware or infrastructure. If your oirganization wants to do a Proof of Concept (PoC) or pilot of an application it would be faster and less expensive on cloud.
- ***Reduced Maintenance***: you need not worry about the upgrade and maintenance of cloud. You can just renew the licence and maintain the infrastructure. Cloud providers will take care of this.
- ***Environment Friendly***: cloud helps your organization by reducing the carbon footprints.

## What is Cloud Migration?

Cloud migration is the process of moving digital business operations (e.g. databases, applications, and IT processes) into cloud from an on-premise system to another cloud. You can think of this as moving from a smaller workarea to a larger premise. Cloud migration requires a lot of preparation and core work. Migration to cloud can give you multiple benefits, such as:

- Increased Cost Savings
- Greater Flexibility
