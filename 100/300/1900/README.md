Having a business continuity plan in place helps you retain your brand value, boost your customer confidence, and reduce the risk of loss. 

The technical strategy for business continuity ensures that internal and external applications, workloads, and services are resilient by remaining operational during planned downtime and unplanned outages.

Typically, high availability relies on redundancy of application components and automatic failover. 

Do you manage apps, having high traffic?
