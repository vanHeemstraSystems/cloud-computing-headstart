## Netflix

Let's look at the achievements of Netflix.

- Netflix processes multiple terabytes of data each day.
- They were provided sub-second response times for analytics queries. This reduced time helps them in having a greater footfall (i.e. number of online visitors). 
- It is very cost efficient as compared to competing solutions.
- Just a few simple API calls were done to ingest data.
- One thousand Amazon Kinesis shards work in parallel making a highly elastic solution. Shard is the base throughput unit of an Amazon Kinesis data stream. This scalability allows Netflix to handle the increased load.
