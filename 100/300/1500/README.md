# 1500 Five Rs of Cloud Migration Strategy

## Rehost

Rehosting is basically having the same thing, but on cloud servers.

Businesses select an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) provider to rehost and reconstruct their application architecture on their infrastructure. 

The expected business outcome is:

- No capital expenditure to get started.
- Free up space in the data center.
- Return On Investment (ROI) in cloud can be achieved rapidly.

## Refactor

In refactoring, already existing code and frameworks are reused by the businesses that choose to refactor.  

Instead of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), they run their applications on a Platform as a Service (PaaS) provider's platform.

The expected business outcome is:

- Updates can be rolled out quickly.
- Benefit from code portability
- Greater cloud efficiency can be achieved in the areas of resources, cost, and speed.

## Revise

Revising encompasses partial rewriting or expanding of the codebase. And then deploying it by either rehosting or refactoring.  

The expected business outcome is:

- Applications are scalable and agile.
- New cloud capabilities can be adopted more easily.
- Different technology stacks can be used.

## Rebuild
