# 1500 Five Rs of Cloud Migration Strategy

## Rehost

Rehosting is basically having the same thing, but on cloud servers.

Businesses select an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) provider to rehost and reconstruct their application architecture on their infrastructure. 

The expected business outcome is:

- No capital expenditure to get started.
- Free up space in the data center.
- Return On Investment (ROI) in cloud can be achieved rapidly.

## Refactor

In refactoring, already existing code and frameworks are reused by the businesses that choose to refactor.  

Instead of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), they run their applications on a Platform as a Service (PaaS) provider's platform.

The expected business outcome is:

- Updates can be rolled out quickly.
- Benefit from code portability
- Greater cloud efficiency can be achieved in the areas of resources, cost, and speed.

## Revise

Revising encompasses partial rewriting or expanding of the codebase. And then deploying it by either rehosting or refactoring.  

The expected business outcome is:

- Applications are scalable and agile.
- New cloud capabilities can be adopted more easily.
- Different technology stacks can be used.

## Rebuild

Rebuild means rewriting and re-architecting the application from scratch on a Platform as as Service (PaaS) providers platform. This allows developers to leverage the advanced features offered by PaaS providers, but would be a labour intesive task. 

The expected business outcome is:

- Help drive innovation as the R&D teams can use diferent cloud services to develop the products.
- Applications can be built faster, providing more time for testing and release activities.
- Operational cost can be reduced compared to the cost of on-premise infrastructure.

## Replace

Enterprises can also opt to get rid of their old applications completely, and switch to already available Software as a Service (SaaS) applications from different third party vendors.

The expected business outcome is:

- Standardize and follow industry best practices.
- Business process-driven approaches can be adopted quickly, improving collaboration in the team.
- Allows more investments into applications that create a difference or provide competitive advantages so that you achieve greater Return On Investment (ROI).
