# 2400 Business Case Studies: HSBC

## HSBC

HSBC Holdings Plc is a Britisch multinational investment bank and financial services holding company.

It serves 39 million customers, in person and online. From consumers to businesses in 66 countries. 

HSBC needed cloud services for:

- Data Safety: It has over 169 petabytes of data on its servers. To retain the data as it is cloud services were required. 
- Managing Data Infrastructure: Managing that much data needs a lot of effort and computing power. HSBC found that they were spending more time managing the infrastructure for data, than using the data to figure out what their customers wanted. 

```
"We have a cloud-first strategy."
- Darryl West, Global Chief Information Officer
```

Here are some achievements of HSBC after adopting cloud services:

- HSBC currently divides workloads across multiple clouds. 
- It uses Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for most Big Data, analytics, and Machine Learning processing as it is super fast over small and large data sets. 
- It splits new digital customer-facing app computes between GCP and AWS, making it a cloud agnostic approach.
- To leverage the benefits of elasticity, flexibility, and cost-efficiency, it uses other clouds plus Microsoft for taking on legacy applications that HSBC gradually moves from proprietary to cloud servers.
