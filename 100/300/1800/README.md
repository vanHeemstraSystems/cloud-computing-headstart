# 1800 Business Continuity Through Cloud

## What Should You Move to Cloud?

Let's look at some reasons why people are moving to cloud.

1. ***Test and Development***: New applications can be brought to the market faster by allowing teams to quickly create and de-provision tet and development environments. Development and test environments can be scaled up and down by leveraging cloud services.  
2. ***Website Hosting***: As compoared to traditional web hosting, running websites on cloud using Infrastructure as as Service (IaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS) can be less expensive. 
3. ***Storage, Backup, and Recovery***: Cloud computing helps in handling unpredictable demand and steadily growing storage needs. The capital expenditure for storage and complexity of managing data are avoided by organizations. Planninmg and management of backup and recovery systems can be simplified.  
4. ***Web Applications***: Cloud provides all the infrastructure required to deploy and support web applications, including storage, web and application servers, and networking resources. Web apps can be quickly deployed and scaled as per the requirement.
5. ***High-performance Computing (HPC)***: Complex problems involving large amounts of data can be solved by leveraging High-Performance Computing (HPC) on super computers, computer clusters, or computer grids. Some of the use cases involving HPC are earthquack and protein folding simulations, evaluating product designs, financial modeling, and climate and weather predictions.
6. ***Big Data Analysis***: Big Data is a common term for huge data sets that contain potentially valuable trends, patterns, and associations. Cloud provides a huge amount of processing power required for mining data sets to locate or pull out hidden patterns.
7. ***Extended Data Center***: Cloud allows you to add capacity to your data center by adding virtual machines in cloud. Instead of incurring the costs of physically adding hardware or space to your physical location.
