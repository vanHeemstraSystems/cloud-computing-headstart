# 1300 Challenges of Cloud Migration

- ***Data Integrity***: the data should remain in tact and secure after it has been transferred and it should not be leaked during the process.
- ***Continued Operation***: during migration, the current systems should remain operational and available for the enterprise and the businesses. To ensure continuous delivery there will be some overlap between cloud and on-premise. Businesses should make sure that migration is done in bits and pieces typically instead of all at once.. 
- ***Interoperability and Portability***: The migration services, in and out of the cloud, should be provided to the customer. The user should be able to move the data between the cloud and on-premise infrastructure. Customers should be allowed to use the same tools and software across a variety of cloud providers.
- ***Migrating Huge Data***: In order to function in cloud, databases might need to move to a different platform. Cloud providers have now started providing services offering physical data transfer, where you get a hardware device couriered to you on-premise to transfer the data onto it and then shipping the storage device back to the cloud provider. This helps reduce the time it would have taken for massive data transfer.   
- ***Reliability and Flexibility***: 
- ***Downtime***: 
- ***Security and Privacy***: 
- ***Costs***: 
- ***Lack of Resources***: 
- ***Management of Multi-Cloud Environment***:
