# 2200 Business Case Studies: 3M

## 3M

The 3M company is an American multinational conglomorate cooporation operating in the fields of Industry, Worker Safety, US Health Care, and Consumer Goods.

Even though it is one of the major manufacturers, when it comes to introducing new businesses, it examines startup costs as closely as any entrepreneur. 

The reasons for which 3M decided to use cloud are: 

- To make the best use of IT agility and cost-effectiveness of new ventures.
- They needed a platform that would provide fast application response time.

```
Because management time and cost is so low with Microsoft Azure, we focus on growing the business, not managing the red tape.
It's important for us to be able to say that VAS is supported by Microsoft Azure, 
prospective customers don't have to worry that their service is running on some anonymous group of servers or at a hoster."

- William K.Smyth, Global Business Manager, 3M VAS
