# 1400 Risks of Cloud Computing

## Placing the trust in the cloud provider

When you depend on a cloud service or a business critical task you put the trust of the business into the hands of the cloud vendor and the quality of their work. This means if you store all your data on Amazon or Azure and one of those services goes down than you do not have access to that data. 

You also need to be aware of the Service Level Agreement (SLA), which is the agreement between you and the provider that says if a cloud provider goes down what will they provide to you in return.

## Slow access to your data

Next is potential for slow access to your data. Assume you might have stored adata and it grows massively over time. You may one day decide to move the data to another data center or download locally. You have the potential for very slow access to that data. You have to keep in mind that your connection to cloud is only as fast as your network connection to the Internet. 

## Legal or regulatory compliance

Third is the potential questions related to legal or regulatory compliance. As an example, financial or government entities cannot just store their data anywhere in the cloud. They have to keep in mind the government regulations and laws associated with the data that they are storing. If you are a company and you are storing health data, employee data, financial data, or credit card data, or any other data that is regulated by the government, you have to take into special consideration which cloud provider you use and where they are storing your data. 

## Loss of customization or control

You should also consider the potential of loss of customization. If you run your own application locally, then you can customize it as you want, assuming you have the source code and the ability to perform the customization. But when you deploy the same application in the cloud then that cloud provider is going to share access to that single application to everyone. And you might not have as much control and potential to customize the application as you would have on an on-premise application. 

## Potential for unknown costs

And last but not least, the potential for unknown costs. Consider if you have your own servers and storage and software application and run everything locally, you know exactly what the cost is going to be. When it comes to cloud computing, there may be scenarios where you consume much more than what you have anticipated. And you might end up with a much larger bill. So cost optimization is something that you should keep in mind.
