# 1400 Risks of Cloud Computing

You also need to be aware of the Service Level Agreement (SLA), which is the agreement between you and the provider that says if a cloud provider goes down what will they provide to you in return.

## Slow access to your data

Next is potential for slow access to your data. Assume you might have stored adata and it grows massively over time. You may one day decide to move the data to another data center or download locally. You have the potential for very slow access to that data. You have to keep in mind that your connection to cloud is only as fast as your network connection to the Internet. 

## Legal or regulatory compliance

Third is the potential questions related to legal or regulatory compliance.
