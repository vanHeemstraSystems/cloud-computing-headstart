# 2100 PaaS

Platform as a Service (PaaS): provides an environment for:

- building
- deploying
- testing

software applications.

The goal of PaaS is to help create an application as quickly as possible, without focusing on managing the underlying infrastructure.

## PaaS: Common Usage Scenarios

Development framework in which PaaS provides a framework that developers can build upon to develop or customize cloud-based applications. Similar to the way you create a Microsoft Excel macro, PaaS lets developers create applications using build-in software components. 

Cloud features such as scalability, high-availability, and multi-tenant capability are included.

PaaS reduces the amount of coding that developers must do. 

Analytics or business intelligence are the tools provided as a service with PaaS that allow organizations to analyze and mine their data.

They can find insights and patterns and predict outcomes to improve business decisions such as:

- forecasting, 
- product design, 
- and investment returns.
