# 2000 IaaS

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): the most common category of cloud computing services.

With IaaS you rent IT infrastructure servers, virtual machines (VMs), storage, networks, and operating systems from a cloud provider on a pay-as-you-go basis. It is an instant computing infrastructure, provisioned and managed over the Internet.
