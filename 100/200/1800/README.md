# 1800 Hybrid Cloud

## Hybrid Cloud: Description

- A hybrid cloud combines both public and private cloud.
- A hybrid cloud allows users to run applications in the most appropriate location, cloud or on-premise.

## Hybrid Cloud: Characteristics

- Hybrid Resource Location: specific resources run or are used in a public cloud and others run or are used in a private cloud.
- Similar to Public Cloud in Cost & Efficiency: hybrid cloud models allow an organization to leverage some of the benefits of cost, efficiency, and scale that are available with the public cloud model.
- Organizational Control and Management: organizations retain management control in private cloud. 
- Requirement of Skilled Technical Personnel: technical skills are still required to maintain the private cloud and ensure both cloud models can operate together. 

## Hybrid Cloud: Example

- An example of a hybrid cloud usage scenario would be hosting a website in the public cloud and linking it to a highly secure database hosted in a private cloud.
