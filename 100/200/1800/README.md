# 1800 Hybrid Cloud

## Hybrid Cloud: Description

- A hybrid cloud combines both public and private cloud.
- A hybrid cloud allows users to run applications in the most appropriate location, cloud or on-premise.

## Hybrid Cloud: Characteristics

- Hybrid Resource Location: specific resources run or are used in a public cloud and others run or are used in a private cloud.
- Similar to Public Cloud in Cost & Efficiency: hybrid cloud models allow an organization to leverage some of the benefits of cost, efficiency, and scale that are available with the public cloud model.
- Organizational Control and Management: organizations retain management control in private cloud. 
- Requirement of Skilled Technical Personnel: technical skills are still required to maintain the private cloud and ensure both cloud models can operate together. 

## Hybrid Cloud: Example

- An example of a hybrid cloud usage scenario would be hosting a website in the public cloud and linking it to a highly secure database hosted in a private cloud.

## Comparison of Cloud Models

Let us start with ***Public Cloud***:

1. No (Capital Expenses) CapEx: you don't have to buy a new server to scale up.
2. High Agility: applications can be made accessible quickly, and de-provisioned when ever needed.
3. Consumption-based model: organizations pay only for what they use, and operate under an (Operational Expenses) OpEx model.

Next is ***Private Cloud***:

1. High Control: organizations have complete control over resources.
2. Control over Security: organzations have complete control over security.

And ***Hybrid Cloud***:

1. Provision for Flexibility: this is the most flexible scenario. With a hybrid cloud setup an organization can determine whether to run their applications in a private cloud or in a public cloud. 
2. Compliance, as required: organizations maintain the ability to comply with strict security, compliance, or legal requirements as needed.
