# 2300 Cloud Computing in Action

## Cloud Computing: Actions

- On-demand and scalable high performance compute virtual machines for analysis and simulation.
- Cloud-designed workstations, which use a workstation hosted on the cloud, that allows the designer to access it from any location.
- The research includes remote data collection, analysis, modelling, and sharing.
- Extracting actionable insights from Internet-of-Things (IoT) data.

Cloud computing can help finances by:

- Cost-effective: having a cloud subscription is more cost-effective as compared to license and maintenance.
- The infrastructure and upgrade costs are reduced when using cloud.
- Faster adoption of new functionality. The releases can be made faster with automatic upgrades. 
- Improved useability, including reporting, analytics, and predictive analysis using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) service in the cloud.
-  Opportunities for process improvement and agility. Fast reporting and shorter planning cycles.
