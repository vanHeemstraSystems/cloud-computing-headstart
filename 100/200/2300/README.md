# 2300 Cloud Computing in Action

## Cloud Computing: Actions

- On-demand and scalable high performance compute virtual machines for analysis and simulation.
- Cloud-designed workstations, which use a workstation hosted on the cloud, that allows the designer to access it from any location.
- The research includes remote data collection, analysis, modelling, and sharing.
- Extracting actionable insights from Internet-of-Things (IoT) data.
