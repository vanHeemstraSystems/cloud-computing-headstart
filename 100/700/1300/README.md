# 1300 Business Continuity

When they migrated to cloud it was important for Airbnb to maintain business continuity. Let's recall that ***business continuity*** refers to the concept of keeping the business running even in the face of a failure or disaster. 

This requires a ***business continuity plan*** that ensures:

- High Availability
- Disaster Recovery
- Resiliency

Business continuity plans help you to:

- retain your brand value
- boost your customer confidence
- reduce the risk of loss

AWS helped Airbnb maintain business continuity in the following ways:

AWS transitioned from Amazon RDS that they started using in 2011 to Amazon Aurora in 2018. With this migration they were able to maintain the business continuity and increase performance. This transistion required them to come up with innovative solutions to maintain business continuity. 

Now Airbnb:

- continues to utilize new services in cloud to drive innovation,
- completed database migration to cloud with a downtime of just 15 minutes,
- uses AWS monitoring services to supervise all the servers through a single console.
