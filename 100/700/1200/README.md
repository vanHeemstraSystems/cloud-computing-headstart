# 1200 Airbnb Business Use Case

## Airbnb: Who are they?

Airbnb is one of the most popular companies, which connects travellers with the property owners. It started almost ten years back and has an estimated market valuation of $31 Billion. 

## Airbnb: What they foresaw

High investment in information technology as well as the cost of operating such huge infrastructure took the company from zero to $31 billion. 

## Airbnb: What did they need?

Soon after the start, the company realized that to succeed they need:

- to move fast and stay lean.
- to minimize time and resources that are used to take care of infrastructure
- to use resources to help in their business rather than administering the infrastructure

## Airbnb: What was their solution?

Airbnb decided to rent the infrastructure and services by migrating to the cloud.

Airbnb today uses Amazon Web Services (AWS), they completely run on AWS cloud. 

## Airbnb: Cloud Services

Some of the AWS cloud services that Airbnb used are:

- ***Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)***: A service that provides more than thousand servers to handle all the production traffic. 
- ***Aurora DB***: A relational database service with billions of rows stored in all relational databases.
- ***S3***: An object storage that stores photos which has Terabytes (TBs) of data stored.
- ***DynamoDB***: A document database adopted for rollups and metadata.
- ***ElastiCache***: An in-memory data store that manages the cache memory.
- ***Route 53***: A scalable and highly available Domain Name System (DNS) service used for DNS and Inventory.

## Airbnb: What have they achieved?

- ***Flexibility***: Allowed greater growth and expansion with readily available infrastructure.
- ***Lower Operating Cost***: Resulted in lower cost compared to on-premises infrastructure.
