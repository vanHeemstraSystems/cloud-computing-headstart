Until now servers, networking components, or storage that was developed by different vendors were providing the compute environment for enterprises. Enterprises used to bet on the best products that could be used to run their applications and the discounts that these vendors provided as part of the enterprise agreement.

The same applies today to cloud infrastructure, where Chief Experience Officers (CXOs) and Chief Information Officers (CIOs) are focusing on architecting the system leveraging hybrid cloud and multi-vendor approaches.
