# 1400 Cloud Security, Compliance, and Vulnerability

## Multi-Cloud Approach

Until now servers, networking components, or storage that was developed by different vendors were providing the compute environment for enterprises. Enterprises used to bet on the best products that could be used to run their applications and the discounts that these vendors provided as part of the enterprise agreement.

The same applies today to cloud infrastructure, where Chief Experience Officers (CXOs) and Chief Information Officers (CIOs) are focusing on architecting the system leveraging hybrid cloud and multi-vendor approaches. 

With the increased adoption of cloud it has become necessary for enterprises to be cloud-agnostic and leverage multiple clouds to run their services or workload. This will help prevent you from vendor lock-in, as well as any unexpected service outage issue that may occur at a specific vendor's end. 

For example, HSBC uses a mix of AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform to divide its workload. 

It uses Google Cloud Platform for Big Data and Analytics and Azure for migrating its legagcy applications to cloud.

## Security Responsibilities of Vendor versus Enterprise

Cloud Security is a shared responsibility, where the vendor and the enterprise are responsible for taking care of data. With the increased movement of enterprises from private to public cloud or Software as a Service (SaaS) applications there is an increase in the responsibility for securing application data and infrastructure by the vendor.  

So today, cloud-based applications and data are spread across multiple environments, such as private, public, and hybrid clouds, which improve agility and reduce operational costs for enterprises.   

Let us look at each of these:
