# 1200 Cloud Security Considerations

## Security Considerations for Cloud

Four main categories:

### Maintaining business functionality and availability

Factors to be considered:

- ***Criticality of your business***: Determine whether you are moving mission-critical data or functionality to the cloud.
- ***Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity***: Consider the time it takes to recover your data and services after a disaster.
- ***Data Backup***: Will you always have a secondary copy of your data, which can be used if the primary copy goes down?
- ***Network Connectivity***: In terms of availability and bandwidth. Is the network connectivity between your enterprise users and the vendor's network sufficient. 
- ***Service Outages***: Service outages are something you cannot overlook. Try understanding what the maximum possible downtime of a Service Level Agreement (SLA) is, which can be tolerated by your business.
- ***Data Restoration***: If you accidently delete a file, e-mail, or some other useful data, how much time does it take for your data to be partially or fully restored from backup. And is the maximum acceptable time captured in the Service Level Agreement (SLA)?
- ***Scalability***: Determine how quickly you can scale your resources if there is a sudden increase in demand.
- ***Switching cloud vendors***: How easy will it be for you to move to another cloud provider?
