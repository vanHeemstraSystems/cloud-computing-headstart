# 1200 Cloud Security Considerations

## Security Considerations for Cloud

Four main categories:

### Maintaining business functionality and availability

Factors to be considered:

- ***Criticality of your business***: Determine whether you are moving mission-critical data or functionality to the cloud.
- ***Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity***: Consider the time it takes to recover your data and services after a disaster.
- ***Data Backup***: Will you always have a secondary copy of your data, which can be used if the primary copy goes down?
- ***Network Connectivity***: In terms of availability and bandwidth. Is the network connectivity between your enterprise users and the vendor's network sufficient. 
- ***Service Outages***: Service outages are something you cannot overlook. Try understanding what the maximum possible downtime of a Service Level Agreement (SLA) is, which can be tolerated by your business.
- ***Data Restoration***: If you accidently delete a file, e-mail, or some other useful data, how much time does it take for your data to be partially or fully restored from backup. And is the maximum acceptable time captured in the Service Level Agreement (SLA)?
- ***Scalability***: Determine how quickly you can scale your resources if there is a sudden increase in demand.
- ***Switching cloud vendors***: How easy will it be for you to move to another cloud provider?

### Protecting data from unauthorized third-party access

Factors to be considered:

- ***Appropriate Cloud Model***: You can choose from public, private, or hybrid cloud models and understand whether it aligns with your risk tolerance.
- ***Data Sensitivity***: Determine how sensitive your data is. Is your data too sensitive to be processed and stored in cloud? Is your data classified as private, sensitive, or is the data available publicly?
- ***Data Access Compliance***: Think about your data being accessed in other countries. Do you abide by the privacy laws of the countries in which your data is being accessed?
- ***Data Monitoring***: Consider monitoring your data. Do you have enough tools to check integrity of data? Can you perform security monitoring effectively?
- ***User Authentication***: Does the cloud vendor provide any identity and access management service? For example, multi-factor authentication, Active Directory sync with your on-premise environment, or federated single sign-on.
