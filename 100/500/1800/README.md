## Walmart

Walmart wants to give customers an omni-channel experience that is a mix of e-commerce and brick & mortar. This gives customers the advantage of accessing the store from anywhere.

Walmart adopted digital transformation. It adopted Microsoft Azure as the cloud infrastructure to grow and enhance their online experience and meet the customer demands with a cloud-powered checkout.

What innovation did they bring in? Walmart now leverages Internet of Things (IoT) platform on cloud to reduce energy consumption for refrigeration units. It uses machine learning techniques to route thousands of trucks backing their supply chain.

All of this has helped Walmart achieve scalability, security, and reduced capital expenditure for its e-commerce sites Walmart.com and Sam's club.com.
