# 1300 Networking Options and Best Practices

## Handling Security Incidents

- ***Vendor Support***: Start by identifying what support you have from the vendor. Is your vendor always available for support? Does your query get resolved within the given Service Level Agreement (SLA)? 
- ***Alerts and Notifications***: Does the cloud vendor provide services, which can help you get notified about critical issues or security incidents?
- ***Log Monitoring***: It is important to monitor your log. Do you have access to audit logs? Can you see activity logs and diagnostic data? 

## Providing Advanced Networking Options

The biggest security risk involved with public cloud services is getting your data exposed to the Internet. Having the right solution in place is necessary so that you get high data throughput by having a dedicated Virtual Private Network (VPN). 

## Security Considerations: Best Practices

- ***Choose appropriate cloud services and explore your shared responsibilities***: Choose appropriate cloud services provided by your cloud service provider and explore your shared responsibilities before moving into cloud.
- ***Encrypt data to protect it from any unauthorized access***: Protect your data from unauthorized access by encrypting the data at rest as well as while in transit. This will prevent any unauthorized access and disclosure of your data. 
- ***Ensure data backup and recovery options are in place***: Ensure data backup and disaster recovery are in place. This protects you in cases of accidental or unintentional deletion of data.
- ***Monitor the performance of your applications on cloud***: Use monitoring services to keep an eye on how your applications are performing in cloud.
