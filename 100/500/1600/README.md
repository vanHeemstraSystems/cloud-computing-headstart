GDPR also has an impact on cloud: 

- To be GDPR ready the enterprise needs to properly plan on where and how the workload will operate in cloud. 
- The enterprise needs to choose the right cloud provider, which can help you with respect to compliance and security to be GDPR ready.

AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform all are GDPR compliant.
