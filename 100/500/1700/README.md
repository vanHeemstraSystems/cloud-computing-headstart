# 1700 Compliance Using HIPAA and HITrust

## Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)

HIPAA is a US healthcare regulation that requires cloud providers to maintain confidentiality and security for the disclosure, use, and safeguarding of individually identifiable health information. It applies to covered entities, doctor's offices, hospitals, health insurers, and other health care companies with access to patients Protected Health Information (PHI) as well as to business associates, such as cloud service and IT providers that processes PHI on their behalf.  

HIPAA has an impact on cloud:

- Cloud providers must enter into contracts to ensure that the business associates will adequately protect Protected Health Information (PHI).

AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform are all compliant with HIPAA.

## Health Information Trust (HITrust) Alliance

HITrust is an organization governed by representatives from the health care industry. HITrust created and maintains the Common Security Framework (CSF), a certifiable framework, to help health care organizations and their providers demonstrate their security and compliance in a consistent and streamlined manner.

Now the Common Security Framework (CSF) builds on HIPAA and the high tech act. These are the US health care laws that have established requirements for the use, disclosure, and safeguarding of individually identifiable health information and the enforcement of non-compliance.  

HITrust provides a benchmark that is a standardised compliance framework, assessment, and certification process.

Cloud service providers and covered health entities can measure compliance against this benchmark.
