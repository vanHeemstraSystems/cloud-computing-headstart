# 1100 Cloud Security

## Why is Cloud Security important?

Cloud security helps to:

- Protect information.
- Provide data and application security using control-based technologies.
- Ensure business continuity.
- Provide data backup, so that data can be retrieved in case any disaster occurs.
- Enforce data maintenance and privacy, by using various processes that address the security controls.

## Public Cloud: Advantages

- ***Provides an enterprise-level firewall***: In a public cloud all your data is behind an enterprise level firewall, which gives your data enhanced security.
- ***Stores and protects data in their datacenter***: Your data resides in the datacenter of the cloud provider ensuring physical security at multiple levels.
- ***Keeps data safe from malicious employees***: It also protects against breach from employees who might try to steal data. There may be malicious insiders.
- ***Relies completely on internal security***: The cloud vendor helps you gain expertise needed in security and also helps you elevate your security posture.
- ***Guards against datacenter or hardware failures***: With public cloud you are also protected from datacenter level failures or hardware failures.
- ***Handles any sudden increase in demand***: You also don't need to worry about sudden increase in demand.

## Private Cloud: Advantages

- ***Provides an internal firewall***: In private cloud setup, your data lives in your private network and can be put behind a firewall.
- ***Protects from data leakage***: It provides protection from data leakage.
- ***Stores data in a private network***: Your private cloud infrastructure is isolated, and there is no need for you to connect to the Internet. 
- ***Keeps data isolated, guarding you from network-related security issues***: This protects you from any kind of security issues that you may face if you are on the network.
- ***Ensures zero downtime even if the cloud providers face shutdown***: And interestingly, there is no downtime even the cloud providers face shutdown.

## Public Cloud: Disadvantages

- ***Grants data access to anyone and from anywhere***: In case of public cloud, data access can be granted to anyone and from anywhere.
- ***Can result in a vendor lock-in***: Since there is a dependency on the vendor, who might become a victim of some disturbance.
- ***Creates dependency on cloud vendors for issue resolutions***: There is also a dependency on the cloud vendor's response issues, which needs their intervention, leading to increased wait time in few cases. 
- ***May be subject to jurisdictional or compliance issues***: Also there are chances that you may become a subject to jurisdictional or compliance issues.

## Private Cloud: Disadvantages
